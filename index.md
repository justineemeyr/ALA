# Accreditation Leadership Academy


## Course Description

The WASC Senior College & University Commission Accreditation Leadership Academy (WSCUC) is a professional development program for higher education leaders. Through the application of both theoretical and practical frameworks for thought and action, the ALA considers the intersections and implications of:

- The need for effective leadership, systems, and evidence to achieve quality
- The assurance of equity and the importance of inclusion and diversity in higher education culture and practice
 
It addresses these themes through a focus on **Equity, Evidence, and Effectiveness** in service of:
 
- Enhancing individual professional practice
- Addressing an institutional need
- Developing skilled leadership in higher education
- Networking opportunities for participants
- Evaluating Technology and its applications
 
The curriculum explores critical and timely issues to produce actionable approaches to a pressing need identified by each participant and their institution. Participants learn through collaboration with Academy faculty and mentors, while simultaneously working with peers in various group settings. Faculty and mentors are leaders in higher education practice drawn from the WSCUC community and from the broader community of scholars and professionals throughout the country and beyond.
